# Aeronautics Data Engineering Project

## This project serves as the final assignment for the Coursera course "ML with Spark" offered by IBM.

## Scenario 
This project, led by our data engineering team at the aeronautics consulting company, focuses on the efficient design of airfoils for planes and sports cars. While our data scientists specialize in machine learning, this project emphasizes my role in ETL tasks and building ML pipelines. We'll be working with a modified version of the NASA Airfoil Self Noise dataset.

## Objectives

### Part 1: Perform ETL Activity
1. **Load a CSV Dataset:** Import the dataset for analysis.
2. **Remove Duplicates and Null Values:** Ensure data cleanliness by dropping duplicate rows and handling null values.
3. **Make Transformations:** Implement necessary data transformations for optimal analysis.
4. **Store the Cleaned Data in Parquet Format:** Save the cleaned data in a parquet format for future use.

### Part 2: Create a Machine Learning Pipeline
1. **Create a Machine Learning Pipeline for Prediction:** Develop an ML pipeline for predicting SoundLevel based on other columns.

### Part 3: Evaluate the Model
1. **Evaluate the Model Using Relevant Metrics:** Assess the model's performance using appropriate metrics.

### Part 4: Persist the Model
1. **Save the Model for Future Production Use:** Store the trained model for future application.
2. **Load and Verify the Stored Model:** Confirm the reliability of the stored model.
